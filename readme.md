`Floating-Point Parameters` - MATLAB Code for Parameters of Floating-Point Arithmetics
==========

About
-----

`float_params` is a MATLAB function for obtaining the parameters of several
floating-point arithmetics.  The parameters are built into the code and are
not computed at run time.

The parameters are

- the unit roundoff,
- the smallest positive floating-point number (subnormal),
- the smallest positive normalized floating-point number,
- the largest floating-point number,
- the number of binary digits in the significand (including the
         implicit leading bit)
and the arithmetics supported are 
- bfloat16,
- IEEE half precision,
- IEEE single precision,
- IEEE double precision,
- IEEE quadruple precision.
